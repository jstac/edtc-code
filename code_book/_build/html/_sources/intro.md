Economic Dynamics Python Code
=============================

**Author**: [John Stachurski](https://johnstachurski.net/)

This lecture series provides a short introduction to the field of continuous
time Markov chains.  Focus is shared between theory, applications and
computation.  Mathematical ideas are combined with computer code to help
clarify and build intuition, as well as to bridge the gap between theory and
applications.

The presentation is relatively rigorous but the aim is towards applications
rather than mathematical curiosities (which are plentiful, if one starts to
look).  Applications are drawn from economics, finance and operations
research.



```{admonition} Computer code

The code is written in Python and is accelerated through a combination of
[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) (vectorized code) and just-in-time compilation
(via [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/)).  

QuantEcon provides a fast-paced [introduction to scientific computing with
Python](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/) that covers these topics.

The code book is written using [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html).
